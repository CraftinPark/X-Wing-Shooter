# X-Wing-Shooter
Legacy Project, Final High School Project, released on my Birthday!

This game was created upon learning about OOP (Object Oriented Programming) for the first time. I was also fascinated at the idea of Enemy AI and mimicked/created it using lots of logic combined with random timings and behaviors. All artwork was designed by me, and I had a lot of fun using Processing to create the background.

### Main Features:
- **X-Wing**
 - Controls:
  - Mode:
   - more maneuverable in Flight Mode
   - less maneuverable in Attack Mode, however grants the ability to shoot
  - Tilt:
   - tilt changes displayed sprite for X-wing
   - also affects the angle of lasers fired.
 - Health affected by collision of bullet objects
 - When idle, X-Wing continues to move in a sinusoidal pattern
- **Enemies**

   - shooting is only permitted during idle
   - movement can be a random direction for a random interval of time
